## Approximating $\pi$ using a simple physics problem (collisiosn in one dimension)
This is one of the most interesting approximations of $\pi$ that I have encountered. 
Let's say you have two boxes, box $A$ with mass $m$ stationary and bos $B$ with mass $\alpha m$ moving to the left. Box $A$ is in between the box $B$ and a wall (located to its left). $B$ pushes $A$ to the left, it collides with the wall and the bounces back and may or may not hit $B$. If $\alpha =10^{2n}$, the number of collisions is the first $n$ digits of $\pi$. This is a simple code simulating this amazing phenomena.
